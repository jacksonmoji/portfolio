you cant be everything to everybody
But for you I am going to be the best i can be for you,
I will be your Father, Bestfriend, Superman, Sensei
I wanna be the one to heal you up, chill you up, build you up
I will be the one to get rid of the ones who try to steal your thunder, roll you under, toss your hopes out
